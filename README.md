# todo

A simple, modern Todo app built with **Next.js + TypeScript** and styled with **SCSS/TailWindCSS**. This repo was bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and includes a Prisma folder ready for local database work — so it's already set up to be extended into a true fullstack app.

## What this repo is (short)

This is a polished frontend for a todo application with a fullstack-ready structure (Prisma is already present). The project follows modern Next.js conventions (App Router) and uses TypeScript for safer code.

---

## Highlights / features

* Todo creation, editing, completion tracking (UI-level)
* SCSS/TailWindCss-based styling and modular component structure
* TypeScript throughout
* Prisma folder included for database modeling and migrations (good starting point for persisting todos)

---

## Tech stack

* **Next.js** (App Router) — modern routing and server components
* **TypeScript** — typed codebase
* **SCSS/TailWIndCss** — styles
* **Prisma** — DB toolkit present in the repo (schema + migrations possible)

## Notes

This README intentionally excludes installation and deployment instructions per your request. If you want those added later (or want the README updated to reflect exact `package.json` scripts and dependencies), paste `package.json` here and I’ll update the README to match.
